# IMPLEMENTATION-_OF_SECURED_WATERMARKING_USING_CRYPTOGRAPHY_TECHNIQUES_AND_BIT_PAIR_MATCHING
Watermarking is one of the most vital digital information hiding technique, which can be used with cryptography mechanism for providing more security to digital data. In the image watermarking mechanism primarily LSB substitution is used on the cover image to hide the secret watermark. In this paper, a novel technique based on the matching of bit pairs and symmetric key cryptography is proposed. Pixel bits of the original image and encrypted watermark image are arranged in pairs. The pixel bits are represented in pairs following the proposed algorithm, then the encrypted watermark pixel bit pairs are compared with all bit pairs of the original image, and accordingly the replacement of bit pairs takes place with the respective matched pair assigned number binary equivalent. If no match is found, replace the 0th pair with watermark bits and replace the two LSB with the value of pair number 0. The proposed mechanism shows good quality of watermarked images along with good PSNR values with a good payload. By comparing the results with some existing algorithms, the proposed scheme shows valuable results.
